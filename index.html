    <h1>SPONSOR A BRIGHT PROGRAM</h1>
    <p class="lead">Education is the bridge that links us from our state of unknowing to the state of knowing. Mentorship is the guide that
	 takes us from a state of knowing, to a state of being able to impliment our knowing in a manner that benefits and makes us better 
	people in the society. This is however not accessible to all despite it being a basic need. More and more children and families live 
	in poverty of both financial will power and information access. We aim to bridge this gap, and we invite you to help.
	Sponsor a bright is an organization running scholarship funds for the needy in the society. 
	It offers a platform where donors can access and sponsor accademically, needy pupils and students in the remotest regions in Kenya.</p>

			By learning with peace of mind in good schoools, our students and pupils are able to score high grades
			From when we start sponsouring a child, to when they graduate, we are there step by step to give them moral and accademic support that is deprived of them from the 
			loss of a parent or parents, we assign a guardian to each child. Guardians can sponsor as many students as they wish, but we recomend that atleast one studentper gurdian is adequate.
			The children feel loved and cared for and are able to overcome lifes challenges.

        <h2>Bright ECD Centres</h2>
        <p>We raise funds to help build early childhood education centres in remote locations that childreen can easily access. Lack of enough ECD centres spread in nearby areas in the remote areas leads to pupils starting
		school from primary. Join us in our quest to increase the number of ECD centres in the ares of Karachuonyo west, Central in Homabay county.We are initiating a cause that will spread acros the county but will start at 
		Karachuonyo. We intend that these facilities are turned over to the county governments who wll manage them as do primary school education. This will inturn lead to a sprout in the number of
		pupils attending ECD centres.</p>
